- Vulnerability: A vulnerability is a weakness or flaw in a system or software that could be exploited by attackers to compromise the security or integrity of that system. Examples of vulnerabilities include software bugs, misconfigurations, or outdated software versions that may leave a system open to attack.

- Exploit: An exploit is a piece of code or technique that takes advantage of a vulnerability to compromise a system or gain unauthorized access. Exploits can be used to deliver malware, steal sensitive data, or take control of a system.

- Threat: A threat is any potential danger or risk to the security or integrity of a system. Threats can come from various sources, including hackers, cybercriminals, malicious insiders, or natural disasters.

- Malware: Malware is short for "malicious software," which refers to any software designed to cause harm or damage to a system or network. Examples of malware include viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, and spyware.

- Virus: A virus is a type of malware that can self-replicate and spread to other computers or systems by attaching itself to files or programs. Viruses are often designed to cause damage, steal data, or gain unauthorized access to a system.

- Botnet: A botnet is a network of infected computers or devices that are controlled by a single attacker or group of attackers. Botnets are often used to carry out large-scale cyberattacks, such as DDoS attacks or spam campaigns.

- Cloud: The cloud refers to a network of remote servers that can be used to store, manage, and process data over the internet. Cloud computing allows users to access and use resources such as computing power, storage, and software applications without having to own or maintain their own infrastructure.

- Firewall: A firewall is a security system that controls and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on a set of predefined rules. Firewalls are often used to prevent unauthorized access to a network or system and to block malicious traffic such as malware or spam.

- Ransomware: Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's files or data and demands payment (usually in cryptocurrency) in exchange for the decryption key. Ransomware is often spread through phishing emails or by exploiting vulnerabilities in a system.

- Trojan: A Trojan (short for Trojan horse) is a type of malware that disguises itself as a legitimate program or file in order to trick users into downloading or executing it. Once installed, a Trojan can perform a variety of malicious actions, such as stealing data or allowing an attacker to take control of the system.

- Worm: A worm is a self-replicating type of malware that spreads through a network or the internet by exploiting vulnerabilities in systems. Unlike viruses, worms do not need to attach themselves to files or programs to spread. Once a worm infects a system, it can use that system to propagate itself to other vulnerable systems.

- Spyware: Spyware is a type of malware that is designed to gather information from a victim's device without their knowledge or consent. Spyware can track a user's internet activity, record keystrokes, and capture sensitive information such as passwords or credit card numbers.

- DoS: DoS stands for Denial of Service, which is a type of cyber attack that is intended to disrupt or disable a network, system, or website by flooding it with traffic or overwhelming it with requests. DoS attacks can be carried out by a single attacker using a single device or by a group of attackers using a botnet.

- DDoS: DDoS stands for Distributed Denial of Service, which is a type of cyber attack that is similar to a DoS attack, but is carried out using a network of compromised devices, such as computers or IoT devices, that are controlled by a botnet. DDoS attacks are often more difficult to mitigate than DoS attacks because they involve multiple sources of traffic.

- Encryption: Encryption is the process of converting data or information into a code or cipher that can only be accessed or deciphered with a specific key or password. Encryption is used to protect sensitive data, such as financial information or personal details, from unauthorized access or theft.

- Encoding: Encoding is the process of converting data or information into a specific format or representation. Encoding can be used for a variety of purposes, such as to transmit data over a network, store data on a device, or protect data from being corrupted during transmission.

- Penetration Testing: Penetration Testing, also known as pen testing, is a type of security testing that involves simulating a cyber attack on a system or network to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses that could be exploited by an attacker. Penetration testing is typically carried out by ethical hackers or security professionals to identify and address security weaknesses before they can be exploited by attackers.

- Vulnerability Scanning: Vulnerability scanning is the process of using automated tools to identify vulnerabilities or weaknesses in a system or network. Vulnerability scanning can be used as part of a larger security testing program, such as a penetration testing, or it can be used as a standalone tool for regular security monitoring and risk assessment.

- Social Engineering: Social engineering is a type of cyber attack that involves manipulating or deceiving people into giving away sensitive information, such as passwords or financial data. Social engineering attacks can take many forms, such as phishing, pretexting, or baiting, and often involve exploiting human emotions, such as fear or greed.

- Clickjacking: Clickjacking is a type of cyber attack that involves tricking a user into clicking on a button or link that performs an unintended action, such as downloading malware or transferring funds. Clickjacking attacks can be carried out by overlaying a transparent button or link on top of a legitimate one, or by hiding a malicious button or link behind an innocent-looking image or text.

- White-Hat: White-Hat is a term used to describe ethical hackers or security professionals who use their skills and knowledge to help organizations identify and address security vulnerabilities and weaknesses. White-hat hackers typically follow a code of ethics and abide by the law, and their work can help improve the security of systems and networks.

- Black-Hat: Black-Hat is a term used to describe hackers or cyber attackers who use their skills and knowledge for illegal or malicious purposes, such as stealing data, disrupting systems, or spreading malware. Black-hat attacks are often motivated by financial gain, political or ideological beliefs, or simply a desire to cause chaos.

- SAST: SAST stands for Static Application Security Testing, which is a type of security testing that is performed on the source code of an application to identify security vulnerabilities and weaknesses. SAST is typically performed as part of the software development process and can help identify and address security issues before they are introduced into production.

- DAST: DAST stands for Dynamic Application Security Testing, which is a type of security testing that is performed on a running application to identify security vulnerabilities and weaknesses. DAST can help identify security issues that may not be apparent from the source code, such as vulnerabilities introduced by third-party components or misconfigurations.

- APT: APT stands for Advanced Persistent Threat, which is a type of cyber attack that is carried out by skilled and determined attackers who use sophisticated techniques to gain unauthorized access to a system or network and maintain access over an extended period of time. APT attacks often involve multiple stages and can be difficult to detect and mitigate.

- Authentication: Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or device attempting to access a system or network. Authentication is typically achieved through the use of usernames and passwords, biometric identification, or other forms of identification, and is a critical component of ensuring the security of a system or network.

- Authorization: Authorization is the process of granting or denying access to resources or actions based on a user's identity and permissions. Authorization is typically controlled through the use of access control mechanisms, such as role-based access control or attribute-based access control, and is a critical component of ensuring the security of a system or network.

- Bug: A bug is a flaw or error in software code that causes the program to behave in unexpected ways or to produce incorrect results. Bugs can be caused by a variety of factors, such as coding errors, design flaws, or unexpected interactions between components, and can lead to security vulnerabilities or other types of issues.

- Ciphertext: Ciphertext is the output of encryption, which is the process of converting plaintext into a secure and unreadable form using an encryption algorithm and a key. Ciphertext can only be decrypted back into plaintext by using the same key and encryption algorithm.

- CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures): CVE is a dictionary of publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities and exposures that provides a standardized way of identifying, describing, and sharing information about vulnerabilities. CVEs are assigned unique identifiers, descriptions, and other metadata to help organizations and security researchers track and address known vulnerabilities.

- Cryptography: Cryptography is the practice of secure communication in the presence of third parties or adversaries. Cryptography involves the use of mathematical algorithms and protocols to protect information from unauthorized access or modification, and to ensure its confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.

- Decrypt: Decrypt is the process of converting ciphertext back into plaintext by using the same key and encryption algorithm that were used to encrypt it. Decryption is an essential component of cryptographic systems, as it allows authorized users to access and read encrypted data.

- DMZ (Demilitarized Zone): DMZ is a network configuration that creates a neutral zone between an organization's internal network and the internet or other untrusted networks. The DMZ is typically protected by firewalls or other security measures and is used to host public-facing services, such as web servers or email servers, that need to be accessible from outside the organization.

- Encryption key: An encryption key is a piece of information used to encrypt and decrypt data in a cryptographic system. Encryption keys are typically generated by a key management system and must be kept secret and protected to ensure the security of the encrypted data.

- Honeypot: A honeypot is a decoy system or network designed to attract and trap attackers, and to collect information about their tactics, techniques, and procedures. Honeypots can be used to gain insights into attackers' behavior, to identify new vulnerabilities or attack vectors, and to distract attackers from real systems or data.

- IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): IaaS is a cloud computing service model that provides virtualized computing resources, such as servers, storage, and networking, over the internet. IaaS allows organizations to outsource their infrastructure needs and to scale their computing resources on demand, without the need for significant upfront capital investment.

- IDS (Intrusion Detection System): An IDS is a security system that monitors network traffic or system activity for suspicious or unauthorized behavior, and alerts security personnel when such activity is detected. IDS can be host-based or network-based, and can use various detection methods such as signature-based, anomaly-based, or heuristic-based.

- IPS (Intrusion Prevention System): An IPS is a security system that goes beyond the detection capabilities of an IDS by actively blocking or preventing unauthorized or malicious activity. IPS can be network-based or host-based, and can use various prevention methods such as packet filtering, protocol validation, or application blocking.

- Insider threat: An insider threat is a security risk that comes from within an organization, such as an employee, contractor, or partner with authorized access to the organization's systems or data. Insider threats can be intentional or unintentional, and can include activities such as theft, fraud, sabotage, or negligence.

- ISP (Internet Service Provider): An ISP is a company that provides internet access to individuals, households, and organizations. ISPs can provide various types of internet connections such as broadband, DSL, or wireless, and can offer additional services such as email, web hosting, or virtual private networks (VPNs).

- Keylogger: A keylogger is a type of malware or hardware device that records every keystroke made on a computer or device, often without the user's knowledge or consent. Keyloggers can be used to steal passwords, credit card information, or other sensitive data, and can be difficult to detect and remove.

- LAN (Local Area Network): A LAN is a network that connects computers and devices within a limited geographic area, such as a home, office. LANs can be wired or wireless, and can be used to share resources such as files, printers, or internet access.

- PaaS (Platform as a Service): PaaS is a cloud computing service model that provides a platform for developing, deploying, and managing applications over the internet. PaaS provides a complete environment for building and testing applications, including programming languages, frameworks, libraries, and tools, and allows developers to focus on their applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

- Packet sniffing: Packet sniffing is the process of intercepting and analyzing network traffic to capture and examine data packets that are being transmitted over a network. Packet sniffing can be done for legitimate purposes such as network troubleshooting and performance monitoring, but it can also be used maliciously to capture sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, or other confidential data.

- Patch: A patch is a software update or fix that is released by a software vendor to address a security vulnerability, software bug, or other issue in a program or operating system. Patches are usually distributed as a downloadable file or through automated updates, and should be installed as soon as possible to prevent security breaches or other problems.

- PKI (Public Key Infrastructure): PKI is a system of digital certificates, public key encryption, and other cryptographic technologies that provide a secure and reliable way to authenticate users, encrypt data, and verify the identity of websites and other online entities. PKI uses a hierarchical system of trust, with a trusted root certificate authority issuing certificates to intermediate certificate authorities and end users.

- SaaS (Software as a Service): SaaS is a cloud computing service model that provides access to software applications over the internet. SaaS applications are hosted by a third-party provider and are accessed through a web browser or other client application, and users typically pay a subscription fee to access the software.

- Sandboxing: Sandboxing is a technique used to isolate software applications and processes from the rest of the system, in order to prevent them from affecting other applications or the underlying operating system. Sandboxing can be used for security purposes, such as isolating a potentially malicious program to prevent it from infecting other parts of the system, or for testing and development purposes, to test software in a controlled and isolated environment.

- SIEM (Security Information and Event Management): SIEM is a software system that provides real-time analysis and correlation of security events and log data from multiple sources, in order to detect and respond to security threats and attacks. SIEM systems collect and analyze data from network devices, servers, applications, and other sources, and use advanced analytics and machine learning to identify patterns and anomalies that may indicate a security incident.

- Sniffing: Sniffing is the practice of intercepting and monitoring network traffic in order to capture data packets, which can be used to analyze network activity, troubleshoot problems, or even steal sensitive information.

- SPAM: SPAM refers to unsolicited and unwanted email messages, typically sent in bulk by spammers to large numbers of recipients. SPAM messages often contain advertisements, scams, or malware, and can be a significant source of security and privacy risks.

- Spoofing: Spoofing is the practice of faking or impersonating an email address, IP address, or other identifying information in order to deceive the recipient or evade security measures. Spoofing can be used for malicious purposes such as phishing, where an attacker sends an email that appears to be from a trusted source in order to trick the recipient into revealing sensitive information.

- Supply chain: Supply chain refers to the network of suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers involved in producing and delivering goods and services to customers. In the context of cybersecurity, the supply chain can be a significant source of risk, as vulnerabilities or compromises at any point in the chain can have ripple effects throughout the entire system.

- Two-factor authentication: Two-factor authentication (2-FA) is a security process that requires users to provide two forms of authentication in order to access a system or service. Typically, this involves a combination of something the user knows (such as a password or PIN) and something the user has (such as a smartphone or hardware token). -FA can significantly enhance security by requiring an additional layer of authentication beyond just a password.
